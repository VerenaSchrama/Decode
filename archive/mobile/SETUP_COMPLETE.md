# 🎉 Mobile App Setup Complete!

## ✅ **What We've Set Up:**

1. **React Native project** with TypeScript
2. **Navigation dependencies** (@react-navigation)
3. **API service** with your backend endpoints
4. **Test screen** to verify API connection
5. **Development server** running

## 📱 **How to Test the App:**

### **Option 1: On Your Phone (Recommended)**
1. **Install Expo Go** app on your phone:
   - iOS: App Store
   - Android: Google Play Store

2. **Scan the QR code** that appears in your terminal
3. **The app will load** on your phone

### **Option 2: Simulator/Emulator**
- Press `i` for iOS simulator (requires Xcode)
- Press `a` for Android emulator (requires Android Studio)

## 🔧 **Current Status:**

- ✅ **Backend API** is running on `http://localhost:8000`
- ✅ **Mobile app** is ready to connect
- ✅ **API service** is configured
- ✅ **Test screen** is ready

## 🧪 **What the Test Screen Does:**

1. **Tests API connection** to your backend
2. **Shows health status** of your backend
3. **Tests recommendation endpoint** with sample data
4. **Displays results** from your AI system

## 🚀 **Next Steps:**

1. **Test the connection** using the app
2. **Build the health assessment form** (main feature)
3. **Create recommendation display** screen
4. **Add habit tracking** functionality

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting:**

### **If you can't connect to the API:**
- Make sure your backend is running: `cd backend && python api.py`
- Check that both your phone and computer are on the same WiFi network
- The API URL is set to `http://localhost:8000` in `src/services/api.ts`

### **If the app doesn't load:**
- Make sure Expo Go is installed on your phone
- Try scanning the QR code again
- Check the terminal for any error messages

## 🎯 **Success Indicators:**

You should see:
- ✅ "API Connected Successfully!" message
- ✅ Backend health data (RAG pipeline status)
- ✅ Successful recommendation test
- ✅ Data collection confirmation
