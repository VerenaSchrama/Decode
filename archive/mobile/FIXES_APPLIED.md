# ðŸ”§ **Story Intake - Fixes Applied**

## âœ… **Issues Fixed:**

### **1. Removed Continue Buttons**
- **Problem**: Every step had both a "Continue" button (that didn't work) and a "Next" button (that worked)
- **Solution**: Removed all "Continue" buttons, keeping only the working "Next" button
- **Files Updated**: All step components (ProfileStep, SymptomsStep, InterventionsStep, HabitsStep, DietaryStep)

### **2. Fixed Step Logic - Interventions vs Habits**
- **Problem**: Steps 3 and 4 were asking about "interests" instead of past experience
- **Solution**: Updated to focus on what they've tried before:
  - **Step 3**: "What interventions have you tried before?" (broad approaches)
  - **Step 4**: "What specific habits have you applied?" (specific implementations)
- **Updated Text**: Changed all labels and descriptions to focus on past experience
- **Step Titles**: Updated to "Interventions You've Tried" and "Specific Habits Applied"

### **3. Fixed 400 Error in Recommendations**
- **Problem**: API was receiving data in wrong format, causing 400 Bad Request
- **Solution**: Updated API service to properly transform Story Intake data to match backend format
- **Key Changes**:
  - Transform `dietaryPreferences` to `dietary_preferences` (snake_case)
  - Ensure all fields have proper defaults
  - Add proper error logging
  - Handle anonymous users correctly

## ðŸŽ¯ **New User Flow:**

1. **Profile** - Basic info (name, age, anonymous option)
2. **Symptoms** - What they're experiencing
3. **Interventions You've Tried** - Broad approaches they've experimented with
4. **Specific Habits Applied** - Specific habits they've implemented (with success tracking)
5. **Dietary Preferences** - How they like to eat
6. **Consent & Privacy** - Data usage agreement

## ðŸš€ **Ready to Test:**

The app should now work properly:
- âœ… Only "Next" buttons (no broken "Continue" buttons)
- âœ… Clear distinction between interventions tried vs habits applied
- âœ… Proper API data formatting (no more 400 errors)
- âœ… Better user experience with logical flow

**Test the full flow now - it should work smoothly!** ðŸŽ‰
