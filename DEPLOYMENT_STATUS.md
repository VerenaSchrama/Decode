# Deployment Status

## ✅ Code Fixes Applied (Committed to Git)
- **Commit:** `f4d8bc4`
- **Age Collection Fix:** Re-enabled NameStep and DateOfBirthStep in intake flow
- **API Endpoint Fix:** Fixed hardcoded API URL to use environment configuration
- **Database Fix:** Removed completion_percentage from intervention_periods operations
- **Column Name Fix:** Fixed InterventionsBASE and HabitsBASE column mappings
- **Authentication Fix:** Fixed token verification structure mismatch

## ⚠️ Current Issue
**Frontend is still showing age as 25 because Vercel hasn't rebuilt with latest changes**

## 🔧 Solution: Trigger Vercel Rebuild
The changes are in GitHub but Vercel hasn't automatically rebuilt. To deploy:
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Manually trigger a redeployment
3. Or push an empty commit to trigger build: `git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger rebuild" && git push`

## 📦 What Needs to Happen
1. Vercel rebuilds with latest code (includes age collection steps)
2. Age will be collected from user input instead of default 25
3. All intake data will be properly stored in Supabase

## 🧪 Testing Locally
If testing locally, the age collection should work correctly as the code changes are local.
